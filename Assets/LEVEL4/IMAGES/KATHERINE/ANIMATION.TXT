34... last frame of flip see above
..... advance/retreat non-existent, use walk

****notes:  the flip is intended to work as a sequence, frame after frame non-repeating,
 OR as a variant flip with the length changing randomly as the middle frames(25,26,27)
are repeated as needed.  This may not work smoothly due to the two exit frames on either side
of the repeating section of the flip.  The exit frames:(28&34 on forward flips,
 24&23 on back flips) will have to be played as flip hits ground-level.
