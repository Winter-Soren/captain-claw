		Our PunkRat walks across the top of the cannon about 
	4 or 5 pixels from the top of the barrel.
		When he lights the cannon, on frame5, there is no 
	reaction from the cannon until the 2cnd .25th of a second.  
	he is then tossed into the air (frame11).  He should be high
	for (.25) and then halfway down at the next (.25)
		He will land as the cannon is moving forward.  
	He should follow this by going forward 15 pixels at the 2cnd
	(.25) and should rest there for (.25) after the cannon comes 
	to rest.
