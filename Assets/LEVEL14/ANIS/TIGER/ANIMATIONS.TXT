Most moves are all over the place except for the walk, and
(pensive, and calm) idle.
*the strikes are delivered from a slight hop stance so 
that they can either stand in one place or slowly locomote
forward to force the enemy backwards-----------
	They are also designed to go smoothly back and forth randomly
from strike1 - strike2 or in any order(ex.  home>strike1>home>strike2>strike1>home....)
**  This strike has the tiger lunging straight out at claw with 
knife and claws exposed foward to land on claw--- 
the exit is the pinwheel Flip
***The flip is designed to be more open than other character's flips,
very acrobatic, yeah, whatever
