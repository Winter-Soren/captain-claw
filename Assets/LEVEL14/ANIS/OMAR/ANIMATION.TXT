   surrender sequence, open position, energy blast, falls on knee and surrenders to Claw


As of 2:40 PM 6/27/97
Everything is painted! Except missing energy blast for strike3 and reflection Damn it!
and the Killfall now comes in three parts:
killfall.......final hit into:
KillFall2......repeating spasmation,is he moving around the screen?, 
In somekind of circlular pattern--whatever!,
 Omar is being held up in energy explosion, I don't know 
how long this is really necessary 'cause I don't know what kind of spanglies are going
to be played, then:
KillFall3.......Omar hits ground, acknowledges that he is defeated, bows to Claw as he has
been defeated by a superior fighter-- freeze for as long as necessary on that last frame
