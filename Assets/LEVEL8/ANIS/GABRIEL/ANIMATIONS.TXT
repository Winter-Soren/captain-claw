WELCOME to the Gabriel animation document
36 frames  
{}=looping  "H" denotes homeposition *READ NOTES below

FastAdvance/Advance(use strikes for locomotion)*...[walk](!!!HandledByProgramming!!!) 
Home........200H..home position
Idle1.......100,101,102,103.....(plays with hair)
                    (100,101,102,103,102,101) 
Idle2........150,151,152,153,154...( mirror thing)(150,....154)
Strike1*......200H,201.........(send out men, shake fist)
Strike2......{202,203,204}....(send out men)
Strike3......201,200........(s.o.m., see previous line)
Strike4......300,301.......(som)
Strike5......302...........(som)
Strike6......301,300.......(som)
Strike7......400,401,402....(drops bomb on Claw's head)
HitHigh.....200H,500,501,500,200H
HitLow......200H,600,601,600,200H

DEATH SEQUENCE**....played in order
HitHigh.....
KillFall1***....(swooning around on platform) {900,901,902,903,902}
KillFall2....(falls off deck)  904,905,906,907
KillFall3....(impacts and bounces on ground level)  {908,909,910}.....
KillFall4....(BIG FINALECurl-up-and-die) {909,911,912},913,914

* since his legs will not be visible(more like amputated),
programming WILL(!whip-crackin' noise here)move the STRIKES1-7
to simulate walking movement, or when Gabby needs to move across the deck

Stike flow chart:(start1)....->S1---------->{S2}>---->S3 (end)
THINK VARIETY!                            /    /..............loop betwn S2 & S5
                 (start2)....->S4--------->S5>------->S6 (end)
these are possible alternatives to two strikes 
offering a rotating three variety
                 
Frame version:
strike cycles:  >>>200---201-{202,203,204}
                     \               \       
                      \               \     
                       <->>>300------ 301<->302

** this death sequence features Claw's last hit leaving Gabriel reeling,
swooning around with hands on chest, he falls over deck of ship, 
landing on ground with heavy impact, rebound and he gives a final spasm and
curl-up in death

*** I put this together with only the KillFall1 needing repeating and mirroring/flipping
the KillFall2 frames were animated going off to the right(the wrong side, I think
for this scene)  they may have to be flipped---I'll see about that at a later date
