*a lot of this animation is matched to my tests which use the sounds on the macserver, some
tweaking may be necessary to match mouth position to sound, we'll see
**Since Aquatis is far too heavy to pick up---
and has no legs drawn---no pickup, thrown, impact, 
or jump cycles needed.  He is sitting in 
one general spot for the whole time; there is 
plenty to hit Claw without walking around.

***Strike two can be used with strike one, as a one-two punch.
