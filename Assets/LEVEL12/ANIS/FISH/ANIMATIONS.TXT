Hit...........500,501  (200H,500,501,500)
KillFall......950     (500,501,950)


*instead of putting just one version in here, Jump is the full sequence( in case
timing can be the same everytime)---- I thought not, so I broke the jump down into more
flexible bits( in case that would work better )

**instead of making a dull old, "head-looks-back-and-forth" ani,  why not give the 
animation some bit of life with a variable time on these two frames?
