Parrot is sidekick/pet of Joe Marrow.  Parrot is designed to sit on objects and attack
in boss-battle with Claw.  His idle is bobbing his head while he is standing.  His attack
is a swipe with his bitty bird sword while he is flying.  Marrow is being animated with an
idle of him calling to, or maybe feeding the bird.  This would be a swoop-by for the bird,
maybe making a small biscuit in Marrow's hand disappear.
*this designed to hold sword sequence within wing sequence
**this frame makes a smoother transition between flying and standing on something
***since there is only ONE hit, it must play either in flight or standing, and 
must continue into either the fly or stand depending on what parrot is doing--- not 
HOME position 
****Feathers are not done, will be done at time they are wanted
(will this guy need these???if so can we reuse seagull feathers?)
Feathers come in two sets:
the explode ends, and the featherfloat is a cycling ani to 
be repeated until the feathers disappear off the screen
