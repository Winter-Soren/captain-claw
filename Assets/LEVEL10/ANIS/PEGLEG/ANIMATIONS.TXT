*idle broken into four parts:1-4(pull out guns and look around slowly)
**Strike 1 is a high bullet shot
Strike 2 is a low bullet shot, the gun shots are designed with the option of being singlely
played, or played in random order (ex:highshot,low shot, idle, lowshot, lowshot,highshot)
the flash for the gun going off are still missing-- painting issue
***just in case it might be needed, I included a backward roll/ simple reverse
It would look more interesting than just one direction for rolling
