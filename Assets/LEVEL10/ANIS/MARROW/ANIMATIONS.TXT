*.....Idle1-4 all same set.  Joe is raising hand over head(1), AND giving a little hand
flick(2,3), and then bringing hand back down again(4).  What is this move for?  Well,
if parrot can land on extended hand-- covering hand movement-- looks like character
interaction.  If used without parrot landing on hand, looks like Joe is giving Claw a 
FAMILY-STYLEtm Italian "curse".
**.....There was some discussion about the parrot lifting Joe and taking him to
opposite bluff from Claw.  This set will work with the parrot grabbing onto the 
sleeve of Joe's raised arm( since the idle looks better with the parrot visually in front
of Joe, that will have to work for this interaction also).
***......with Joe not being able to be picked up by Claw, this means the impact might
never be used.  Unless the parrot can get hit while carrying Joe, and he gets dumped.
hmmm!
****....a rather minor death sequence:  this whole set goes through Joe going back in a high
hit, coming back forward for a short bit, and then falling backwards, and off screen.
